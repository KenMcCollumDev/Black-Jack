/*
X	reuse deck of 52 lib

X	1	cli ask # of players.
F	2	shuffle deck
3	create players 
4	for each player deal.  recursive until end of players.  deck of 52 becomes deck of 1 less for each card drawn
5	recursive for each player draw cards until >= 21 or limit (look up cor4rect strategy for B.J.).  recursive until end of players
6	display AI hand hole card(s) unknown + showing card(s)
	special case: player hand: display all (just take the deck of 52 notation)
7	checkOutcome after each draw for >21 and = 21; if last turn, then check for highest score of players not gone over


	// put the AI stuff here how many cards are of value such that hand + card <= 21?  what proportion when divided by # of undealt cards?
	// how high to keep going given cards remaining?  maybe a rule of thumb
	// put the visibledeck management stuff here
	// put the dealtDeck management stuff here

after this I could do canasta
with a deck of 108 (including the jokers)
would need an AI
